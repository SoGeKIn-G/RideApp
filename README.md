# RideApp
RideApp enables riders to discover nearby auto/taxi drivers in real time, view availability, sort drivers by distance, and directly contact them. Drivers can register, manage profiles, update GPS or zone-based location, toggle availability, and receive requests. Keypad phone drivers are supported via SMS commands.
